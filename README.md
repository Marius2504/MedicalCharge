# :robot: MedicalCharge :car:

## :arrow_forward: Introduction
Accidents happen all the time and can lead to unexpected medical costs. This project aims to predict medical charge for the majority of patiens 

## :memo: Description
Prediction represents a quite ambigous task, especially due to its uncertainty. This project aims to detect a close price for medical interventions based on previous prices.
Machine Learning Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome

The evaluation measure is calculated as the average of the squares of the errors - MSE

## :computer: Implementation
Dataset consists of multiple rows that represent the information for every previous patient. Model is imported from tf.keras.models.Sequential and represent an Artificial neural networks(ANN). 
Acurracy is described by the loss function which is computed using mean squared error formula.


## :exclamation: Instructions

The application can be started using build and run command inside IDE.
